# PROG_POE_PART3_ST10453370

In the start of the POE PART 3, the first instruction was to convert our code from using the console, to creating a GUI with the Windows PResentation Foundation.
I created a GUI and implemented all the same feuteres of part 1 and part 2 onto the GUI. The program will start by asking for a name and surname to login,
i used this instead of a user having to tell the chatbot their name, the chatbot can simply get the name from the login details. Then i added a task manager which allows
a user to create task by typing the words "set up" or "add task". The program will then ask the user if they want top set a description for the task. Then it will ask if they want to set a reminder for the task. 
The reminder  a user can type things like: Remind me in 2 ddays, or remind me in 30 minutes. Then the application gets an exact time and date for the reminder and adds it to a list.
The list can be viewed at any time and task can also be deleted. I also added a Cyber security mini game, which on a seperate window than the chatbot interface. The purpose of this is to test our knowledge of cybersecurity while having a fun challenge. The quiz consists of true or false, monkey puzzle and normal short question answers. 
It gives you a score at the end after scrolling through the questions.
Lastly we used an activity feature, which we can see our activities that we did on a log. We do this by adding the activities to a list, as soon as they happen. For example, when a task is created, we add the activity that was detected to a list, but we dont show it yet. Then when a user ask for the activity log, we display the latest 5 records for the user to seee. We use NLP throughout the program and on various occasions.
